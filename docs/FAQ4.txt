The master and expert of the game Ryan Winslow can explain it a lot better. I did my best. I am trying 
to help to understand the game to make it easier to adjudicate

To find out about the game go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanc...sure_of_Tarmin

The player begins the game with the lowest level bow, a small supply of food, a number of arrows dependent 
on the selected difficulty level, and minimal "Spiritual" and "War" health. Randomly placed throughout the 
maze are new weapons, armor, magical items, and treasure.[3] The treasure in the maze (aside from the 
Treasure of Tarmin the Minotaur holds) can either boost the player's score (visible from the map screen), 
contain a potion (blue, pink, or purple in large and small varieties), or a bomb reducing the player's war/spiritual score. 
The bomb can cause a game over depending on the strength of the player at the time of the bomb trigger.

To increase health, the player must either attack or be attacked by enemies, followed by resting (consuming a 
food item), which has a chance to increase either war or spiritual health based on the weapons the player has used. 
With the aid of Spirit or War tomes found in treasure chests, this chance may be increased greatly. The player's 
maximum health (with the aid of maximum-health limit increasing books and potions) is 199 War points and 99 Spiritual.

In the outer hallways, gates between adjacent mazes on the same level may be encountered. Passing through a green 
gate reduces the player's spiritual health and boosts the player's health, and the opposite effect occurs passing 
through a blue gate. Use in conjunction with war or spiritual books can boost respective health significantly. 
Passing through a tan gate changes nothing.

The player may keep going down levels (by accessing a ladder located inside each maze) until level 256, after which 
the game cycles the player back to level 1, with the player's character retaining their inventory and health, but 
attacking enemies at the first floor's easier difficulty.

It is possible to be defeated but not lose the game. Upon dying, the player can be 'reincarnated' to another section 
of that maze, with all of their pack's inventory gone while retaining the contents of their weapon and shield slots 
as well as their supply of arrows and food.

Here is a Game Faq I created on what I found out about the game here below:


How to tell what the difficulty of the game, is by how many Mazes their are at the start of the game ,within 
they have a map with randomly created dungeons with levels the lowest level has the Minotaur that has the Tarmin 
Treasure the main goal of the game.

Harder the difficulty the more mazes their are in the game, and monsters are harder to kill.

Easiest will have only 1-> Maze

Easy will have around 3 -> Mazes

Medium will have around 8 to 9-> Mazes

Hard will have around 18-> Mazes

At the bottom left corner in yellow lettering is your compass direction
n-north,
s-south,
w-west,
e-east
also, inventory of weapons for Physical Weapons like the regular bow 6 attack & steel bow has 15 attack must 
have arrows to use , Hatchet can only throw to attack or magical weapon like the Scrolls are reusable or Fire 
Ball are 1 time use etc.

At the lower bottom right corner in yellow reading from right to left in yellow are your PHYSICAL HEALTH / 
SPIRITUAL or MAGIC HEALTH the numbers that are your Physical Defense & Magic Defense and the numbers at 
the bottom are Physical-> 6 & Magical Attacks-> 6

A player can rest after battles to recover health
Your health increases after killing a monster

Easiest War Health ->18 / Spiritual Health->9
Physical Defense-> 0 & Magic Defense-> 0
Physical Attacks -> 6 & Magical Attacks-> 0

Easy, War Health ->16 / Spiritual Health->8
Physical Defense-> 0 & Magic Defense-> 0
Physical Attacks -> 6 & Magical Attacks-> 0

Medium War Health ->14 / Spiritual Health->7
Physical Defense-> 0 & Magic Defense-> 0
Physical Attacks-> 6 & Magical Attacks-> 0


Hard War Health ->12 / Spiritual Health->6
Physical Defense-> 0 & Magic Defense-> 0
Physical Attacks-> 6 & Magical Attacks-> 0

The the number in green at the the bottom middle of the screen is the monsters Hit Points & their are physical 
The skeleton and magical the Dwarf
