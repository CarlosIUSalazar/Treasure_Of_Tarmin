### _Intellivision 1983_

## Overview

This is a complete 3D Remake of the 'Treasure of Tarmin' game released for Intellivision 
on 1983 by Tom Laughrin.

This is the first game I ever saw being played when I was very little and made a strong 
impression on me.  This is my effort to preserve the genius and creativity behind this
game while adding quality of life and accessibility features to hopefully make it reachable
to modern players.

I'm striving to keep the original art and rules as close as I can.  First I'll make this
game Mobile Web based to enhance the ease of accessibility. In the future I may convert to
a PC version.

I have done research on the mechanics and multipliers and intricacies of this game from
different sources.  However there are some details that I have not found official values 
for in which case I'll make efforts for the game to behave as close as I have anecdotally
seen it play over the decades.   Please note some things will be inevitably a bit different
than the original game.
